##Prologue:
Hey look, buddy. I'm an engineer, that means I solve problems. Not problems like "What is beauty?", 'cause that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy. I solve practical problems! - Red engineer 
## About me 😁:
I'm an advanced student in the Computer Engineering degree program at the National University of Córdoba (Argentina). I'm currently working on projects for my college and learning backend development in Python with Django. Have a nice day! 🦾
